# API Integration Progress

## Completed ✅
- [x] Created .env file with VITE_API_URL configuration
- [x] Updated LoginPage.tsx to use fetch API with VITE_API_URL
- [x] Updated RegisterPage.tsx to use fetch API with VITE_API_URL
- [x] Added proper error handling for network requests
- [x] Added token storage for authenticated requests

## Implementation Details

### Environment Configuration
- Created `.env` file with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`
- Uses fallback to `http://localhost:5000` if environment variable is not set

### LoginPage.tsx Changes
- Replaced hardcoded authentication with API call to `/api/auth/login`
- Added proper error handling for network failures and API errors
- Stores both user data and JWT token in localStorage
- Maintains role-based navigation (admin → dashboard, user → profile)

### RegisterPage.tsx Changes
- Replaced simulation with API call to `/api/auth/register`
- Added proper error handling for network failures and API errors
- Sends name, email, password, and phone fields to backend
- Maintains success flow (registration → login page)

## Next Steps (Optional)
- [ ] Add phone number field to registration form if required by backend
- [ ] Implement proper toast notifications instead of alerts
- [ ] Add form validation before API calls
- [ ] Create reusable API service functions
- [ ] Add loading states for better UX
- [ ] Implement proper logout functionality that clears tokens

## Backend Requirements
- Backend should be running on port 5000
- Endpoints should return JSON with `success` boolean and `data` object
- Login endpoint: `POST /api/auth/login` expects `{email, password}`
- Register endpoint: `POST /api/auth/register` expects `{name, email, password, phone}`
